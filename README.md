### Introduction

This project considered as rebuild or refresh the current [movietube_backend](https://github.com/AbdAlghaniAlbiek/herafi_backend) repo using [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

### About

This project serves 2 client application (Android & UWP apps) by making APIs that enable these apps to consume them and fetch data from them, this Backend application contains many many modules that described in NestJS documentation like: Caching, Uploading, Swagger, Task Schedualer, Queues.....

## ðŸš© Setup

To Initialize this NestJS project you need follow these instructions:

1. Node.js runtime from its website (or using nvm) => 16.5v or above
2. `git clone https://github.com/AbdAlghaniAlbiek/movietube-nestjs-backend`
3. `npm install`
4. Remove the current `.env.vault`
5. Create your own project on dotenv by following their docs
6. Create your .env with your secrets following the structure of `.env.example`
7. `npm run start:dev`

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

Various of libraries (modules) has been used that make this project able to handle requests of those 2 client applications, so I'll go forward descriping these modules that I used.

### âš™ Configurations

The configuartion of all services and modules of this project it loaded from **.env** file and this sync with [dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org/) host service so all team members can push/pull (with custom permmision) securitly privatly between them without send **.env** files in emails or slack environments

`ConfigModule` it depends on custom hand-made functions that load data then they implemented in this module, by this We can call `ConfigService` with custom interface refers to that implemented functions, with that we can hard-coded all strings that existing in **.env** file.

### ðŸ§¾ Mapping Data

`MapperModule` makes the way of mapping data from **entites** to **DTOs** and vice versa so easily by defining classes that have profiles about how mapping operation between **entites** and **DTOs** will happen.

### ðŸ›¢ Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

In this project I used `MongooseModule` to connect to mongodb database and make realtions between schema classes and db tables, by this I cut short Entites Repo layer and I can use **InjectModule(Schema)** decorator directly instead, and make various of sql operations on db in easily way.

### â›“ Queues Pattern

This pattern enable backend server to make jobs in certain queues and these jobs do some operations on seperate process freeing the process that run my Nestjs backend to handle various of requests, and it depends on **producer-consumer** jobs concept by adding jobs to the queues and remove them when they complete their mission.

`BullModule` is the library that used for this purpose and it heavily depends on [Redis](https://redis.io/) caching mechanism .

### ðŸ“§ Sending Emails

`MailerModule` makes sending emails to the clients much easier than before, and I connect its configuration with SendGrid environment, so it pretty awesome to see your emails sended on these 3 applications.

### âš¡ Event Emitter

Events is so powerful tool to handle various of backend operations outside of specific scope, so we can use everywhere, and `EventEmitterModule` makes functions that have **OnEvent** decorator available in all of this project so we can call it in any controller, service, guard, pipe, .... so easily.

### ðŸ’¾ Caching Data

Caching is so important in backend world that makes response of backend so fast, I used `CacheModule` for caching most requested data from the server like **cities** data and so on.

`CacheModule` is using RedisOptions so it depends on [Redis](https://redis.io/) configuration for caching data.

### ðŸ“– Swagger

Implementing Open API principles using `SwaggerModule` and I made a specific swagger UI for each client application in specific route

### ðŸ›¡ Security

This project it contain on all possible security tools to make backend server secure as possible as it can

#### Authentication & Authorizaiton

I used for `Authentication` process [JWT](https://jwt.io/) RSA-512 Access/Refresh based Tokens so it's very high secure level for each client and server sides, and for `Authorization` process I used **RBAC**(Roles Based Access Control) concept to control who can access to resources of the server

`Passport-jwt` & `@nestjs/passport` libraries very helpful and make the implementation process to backend server more easier.

#### Encryption/Decryption & Hashing

Securig data by encrypting and decrypting it using AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and for hashing password in one way I used `bcryptjs` for maximum password security.

#### Throttler

`ThrottlerModule` is so crusial to prevent infinte requests on the server and this module solve this problem by adding TTL(Time To Life) and limit for each session of user on the backend server

#### Exception Filter

It can filter any type of HttpExcption that produce it by any layer of application (Mapper layer, validation layer, services layer, repos layer, controllers layer) and send a specific type of json data to client side. We can acheive that with custom `exception-filter` build inside this project.

#### Validation

All data that comes from clients' requests in **_Body_** validated (either in body schema or properties' data rules) by `ValidationPipe` and for **Param** or **Query** data all of them validated and transformed using `parseIntPipe`, `parseFloatPipe`, `parseEnumPipe`...

#### CORS & Helmet & CSRF

Implementing the required middlewares to make server protected from any maleware, spyware, warm viruses.... by using these middlewares

- `CORS` (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources
- `Helmet`, Helps in setting various HTTP headers that protect headers from any potentialy threat
- `CSRF` (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protect from attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated
